        <h1>Learn what ss IMDB</h1>
        <p>IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database)
            is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, 
            and streaming content online â€“ including cast, 
            production crew and personal biographies, 
            plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.
             An additional fan feature, message boards, 
             was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, 
             the database is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
    
            As of December 2020, IMDb has approximately 7.5 million titles (including episodes) 
            and 10.4 million personalities in its database,[2] as well as 83 million registered users.
            
            IMDb began as a movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990 
            and moved to the web in 1993.</p>
